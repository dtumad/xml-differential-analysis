Basic files: all pass

Long files: all pass (javascript dom extrememely slow)

Billion Laughs:
- python lxml reports reference looping by default
- python etree reports expansion bound being breached by default
- javascript dom doesn't expand the entity after noticing, but doesn't error out

Quadratic Blowup:
- python lxml reports reference looping by default
- python etree reports expansion bound being breached by default
- javascript dom doesn't expand the entity after noticing, but doesn't error out

Unicode:
- python lxml requires a lot of configuration up front (however it gives explicit errors to the user of this fact)
- python etree works (but writes out as bytes without configuration, feels like a potential attack here maybe?) 
- javascript dom works with no changes at all

XML version and encoding tag:
- python lxml does not preserve by default
- python etree does not preserve by default
- javacript dom handles automatically

XXE attack:
- python lxml by default just prints the file, if file not found just omits without error
- python etree w/ default settings will report file not found as it doesn't allow without explicit enable
- javascript dom by default will leave the entity in the `&xxe` form
